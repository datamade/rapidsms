    The coordinated-entry-screening tool runs a script (`hash_identities.py `) that hashes

    A user may be *returning*. If so, their identity is hashed. This function, thus: 
    (1) finds the connection given a hashed identity â€“ `hash_identities` uses 
    Django's `make_password` to hash identities, and this function uses 
    Django's `check_password` to find connections with hashed identites.
    (2) un-hashes the identity, so that the app can communicate with Twilio.
